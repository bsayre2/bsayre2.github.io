      <p>Team Lead: I am a 22 year old senior here at Eastern Michigan university. 
        I took on team lead because I wanted a challenge, though I’m sure this class will be a challenge itself. 
        I am looking to go into software development or follow my folks into IT management.</p>

      <p>Team Member: Senior Computer Science Major in my last semester at EMU. I like to golf in the summer, 
        and rock climb in the winter. I’m excited to graduate and use the skills 
        I've accrued here at EMU to start a career in software development, 
        and this project seems like a great last step before accomplishing that.</p>
